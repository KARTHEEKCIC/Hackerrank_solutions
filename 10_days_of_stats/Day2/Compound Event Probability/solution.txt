Objective 
In this challenge, we practice calculating the probability of a compound event. We recommend you review today's Probability Tutorial before attempting this challenge. 


Task 
There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z. 


Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls. 

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

Solution
Probability of getting a red ball from urn X = 4/7.
Probability of getting a black ball from urn X = 3/7.

Probability of getting a red ball from urn Y = 5/9.
Probability of getting a black ball from urn Y = 4/9.

Probability of getting a red ball from urn Z = 4/8 = 1/2.
Probability of getting a black ball from urn Z = 4/8 = 1/2.

Favourable outcomes - 

1) 1 black ball is drawn from urn X and 2 red balls are drawn from the other two urns
   So, Probability for the above case, p1 = (3/7)*(5/9)*(1/2)

2) 1 black ball is drawn from urn Y and 2 red balls are drawn from the other two urns
   So, Probability for the above case, p2 = (4/9)*(4/7)*(1/2)

3) 1 black ball is drawn from urn Z and 2 red balls are drawn from the other two urns
   So, Probability for the above case, p3 = (1/2)*(4/7)*(5/9)

So, Total probability of drawing 3 balls (One from each) such that 2 of them are red and 1 is black = p1+p2+p3 = 17/42.
