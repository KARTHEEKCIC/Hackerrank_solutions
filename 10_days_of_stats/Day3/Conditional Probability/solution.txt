Task 
Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?


Solution
So the sample space is  {BB,GB,BG,GG} where B - Boy and G - Girl.

So the probability that both children are boys given that one of them is boy, P = Probability that both of them are boys / Probability that one of them is boy

Probability that both of them are boys = 1/4
Probability that one them is boy = 3/4

Therefore the probability P = (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3
