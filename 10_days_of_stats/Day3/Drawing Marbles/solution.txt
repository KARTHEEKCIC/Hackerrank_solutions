Objective 
In this challenge, we're reinforcing what we've learned today. In case you've missed them, today's tutorials are on Conditional Probability and Combinations and Permutations. 


Task 
A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

Solution
Given that the first ball drawn is red.

So, the number of red marbles left in the bag = 2
    the number of blue marbles left in the bag = 4
    
Now, total number of marbles left in the bag = 6

Therefore, the probability that the second marble drawn is blue = 4/6 = 2/3
