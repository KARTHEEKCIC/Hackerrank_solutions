Task 
You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?


Solution
Let a person draw a card from the deck. Now we need to find the probability that the next card drawn is from the same suit such that the previous card is not replaced.

So, Total number of cards left in the deck = 52 (Size of the sample space)

Total number of cards of the same suit as that of previous one that are left in the deck = 12

Therefore, the probability that both cards are of the same suit = probability the second card drawn is from the same suit as previous one = 12/52.
